* Basebox able to start Vagrant machine.
Vagrant Box able to start vagrant box.

** Rational
The issue I was facing was that I need to have a "hardware node" that
would be always the same to start my Vagrant Boxes.  But, sometime,
the kernel needs to be updated, conf change, so the base box launcher
would sometime break.  

So I decided to have a basebox that would insulate me from the
hardware node change.

** Limitations
You lose part of hardware vitalization.  Things are slower, but don't
break randomly.
