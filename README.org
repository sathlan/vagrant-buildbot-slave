* Basebox able to start Vagrant machine.
Vagrant Box able to start vagrant box.

** Rational
The issue I face is that I need to have a "hardware node" that would
be always the same to start my Vagrant Boxes.  But, sometime, the
kernel needs to be updated, conf change, so the base box launcher
would sometime break, especially with complicated bridged network.

So I decided to have a basebox that would insulate me from the
hardware node change.

** Limitations
You lose part of hardware vitalization.  Things are slower, but don't
break randomly.

** Requirements
The basebox is based on a personal [[https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee-old][veewee-old]] definition, that can be
found [[git://github.com/sathlan/veewee-definitions.git][there]].
